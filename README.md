# ðŸ¥© MeetApp

presents location based it-events. Its a serverless progressive wep application (PWA). The application uses the Google calendar API to fetch upcoming events. Its downloadable using a shortcut. It provides a visual presentation of the events as a graph. 
And it uses AWS Lambda serverless functions to provide a token to access the GoogleAPI. Test Driven Development was used during the development process.

## Why ServerLess for  ðŸ¥© Meet

- scalable  
We start with very few users
- cost effective  
no permanent server cost  
- industry standard  
good practise to use
- easy to deploy  
I can focus on Code, no server configuration or maintanance needed

## Feature: Filter Events by City

As a **user**,  
I should be able to **filter events by city**  
So that **I can see a list of events taking place in the city**  
SCENARIO 1  
User filters events by city

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Given** the user opened the events app  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**When** they select the option to filter by city and they enter the name of   the city  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Then** events from that city will be displayed to them

## Feature: Show/Hide Event Details

As a **user**,  
I should be able to **view details of the events**  
So that **I can see what is taking place in the event**  

***Scenario: User views events details***

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Given** the user was on the events page  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**When** the user selects the city "CityName" from the filter options  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Then** the events displayed should be filtered to show only those in "CityName"  

## Feature: Specify Number of Events  

As a **user**,  
I should be able to **specify the number of events**  
So that **I can control how many events are showb in the list**  

***Scenario: User specifies the number of events***

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Given** the user was on the event apps home screen  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**When** the user navigates to settings or options  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And enters the specified number of events to display  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Then** the app should confirm the changes to the numner  
and display the specified number of events

## Feature: Filter Events by City (ChatGPT helped until the end)

As a **user**,  
I should be able **filter events by city**  
So that **I can see a list of events taking place in the city**

***Scenario: User filtered events by city***

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Given** the user was on the events app home screen  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And** there are events available in different cities  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**When** the user navigates to the events filter section  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And** selects the option to filter events by city  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And** chooses the desired city as "{city}"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And** applies the filter  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Then** the app will display only the events that are taking place in the selected city  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And** the user will see a clear indication that the events are filtered by city

## Feature: Use the App offline

As a **user**,  
I should be able to **use the app offline**  
So that **I can search cities and view events without connection**

***Scenario: User rides subway with no connection and uses the app***

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Given** the user has the app installed on their device  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And** the user is about to ride the subway with no internet connection  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**When** the user opens the app  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And** attempts to browse events or access app features  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Then** the app should provide a notification or indication that it's offline  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And** the user should still be able to view previously loaded data or cached content

### Feature: add a app shortcut on the home screen

As a **user**,  
I should be able to **add a shortcut to the home screen**  
So that **I can access the app fast and easy from the homescreen**  

***Scenario: User adds a shortcut for the app on their home screen***

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Given** the app is installed on the user's device  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And** the user is on the device's home screen  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**When** the user performs an action to add a shortcut for the app  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Then** a shortcut icon for the app should appear on the home screen  

### Feature: Visualize the events data

As a **user**,  
I should be able to **display charts visualizing event details**  
So that **I can assess the events content fast at a glimpse**

***Scenario: User wants to visualize the events data in charts and tables***

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Given** the user is using the events app  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And** there is events data available for visualization  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**When** the user navigates to the data visualization section  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And** selects the option to view events data in charts and tables  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Then** the app should display visual representations such as charts and tables for the events data  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**And** the user should have the ability to interact with and customize the visualizations
